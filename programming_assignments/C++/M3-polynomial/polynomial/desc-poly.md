**Objective:** Learn to overload various operators.


[Polynomial] is a mathematical expression consisting of terms summed to
each-other. In this exercise you will implement class Poly, holding a
single polynomial where each term is of form **mul**x**exp**. For
example, the parabola 4xÂ²+2x+7 would be stored in the Poly object as
`std::map<int, int>` of pairs of exponent and multiplier: (2, 4), (1,
2), (0, 7).

The comments in file **src/poly.hpp** provide more detailed
instructions of the functions you will need to implement.
