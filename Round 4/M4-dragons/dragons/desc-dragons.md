title: Dragons
task_id: M3-DRAGON
points: 4


**Objective:** Practice abstract classes and inheritance. This time
  you will also need to implement the base class interface, and deal
  with the Rule of Three (RO3).

In this task you will need to implement various kinds of
dragons. **Dragon** (*dragon.hpp*) is an abstract base class for
different kinds of dragons: **FantasyDragon** (*fdragon.hpp*),
**ChineseDragon** (*cdragon.hpp*), and **MagicDragon**
(*mdragon.hpp*). Following good modularization principles, each of the
classes is defined in its own header file, and the implementation of
the particular class should be in respective .cpp file.

In addition, you will need to implement **DragonCave** (also in
*dragon.hpp*) that stores the different kinds of dragons.

The header files give more detailed instructions about the functions
you will need to implement.
