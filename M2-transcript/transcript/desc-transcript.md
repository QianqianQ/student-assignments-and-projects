title: Transcript
task_id: M2-TRANSCRIPT
points: 2


**Objective:** More practice with algorithms and iterators, try also
  lambdas in action.

**Transcript** is a structure that holds the course records for a
  particular student. For each student there is a list of course/grade
  pairs for all the courses the student has passed. Again,
  **transcript.hpp** contains definitions of functions that you will
  need to implement. Read the comments in the header file to see what
  these functions will need to do.

You will gain one point by implementing functions **addTranscript**
and **removeTranscript** that will add and remove entries from
transcript list.

You will gain a second point by implementing function
**findTranscript** and **findCourseResults**:

- **findTranscript** should find entries based on student ID

- **findCourseResults** should return a list of student ID/grade pairs
    corresponding to a course name.

`NOTE: findCourseResults description and test cases corrected on 2015-09-24 19:46`

These functions will not require many lines of code if you use
algorithms efficiently.
