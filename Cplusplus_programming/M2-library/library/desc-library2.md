title: Library II
task_id: M2-LIBRARY
points: 2


**Objective:** More practice with containers.

This exercise continues the library implementation from Module 1 by
adding a new class, **Library**, that collects together books, and
customers loaning the books. You will need to start from finishing the
definitions in file **library.hpp** according to the instructions in
the comments, and then implement **library.cpp**.
