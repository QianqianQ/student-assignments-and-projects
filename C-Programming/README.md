A simple program that simulates a zoo

Functions including: Add an animal, Delete an animal, List available food types, Define diet, Eating food, Print zoo information, Save zoo to a file, Loading zoo from a file, Exit program.

Data structure: linked list

Properties:

Animal's name could be arbitrarily long.

A list of available food types is set by programmer, and users choose a certain kind of food from it to define a animal's diet.

The Eating food function affect animal's weight (if animal does not like the food, it will affect animal's weight negatively).

If animal's diet has not defined yet, or the food user input is not in the list of available food types (zoo staff could not provide this food type), Eating food function will do nothing.
