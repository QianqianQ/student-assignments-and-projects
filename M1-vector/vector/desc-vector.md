title: Vectors
task_id: M1-VECTOR
points: 1

**Objective:** Practice basic handling of STL *vector* container.

In this exercise you will need to implement the following three functions that operate on prefilled int - type vectors.

  * `getMin` that will return the smallest value stored in the vector.

  * `getMax` that will return the largest value stored in the vector.

  * `getAvg` that will return the average of the values stored in the
    vector. The returned value will be of *double* type, even though
    the input values are *int*.

**vector.hpp** in src directory of the task template defines the exact interface for the above three functions.
