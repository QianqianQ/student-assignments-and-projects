**Objective:** Practice creating a template class from scratch

In this exercise your task is to implement a template class from a scratch. As some of you might have already noticed templates can be very useful when writing container like classes. Implementing the containers with templates ensures that the container is type independent, i.e. supports different types of objects.

Your task is to implement a template container class, Triple. Triple is much like a pair, but with three values instead of two. A triple can either be homogenous or heterogenous, meaning that it can either have three values, all of which are the same type, or it can contain different types.

The Triple class that you have to implement has been declared in more detail, in the given triple.hh file. Remember to test your program before submitting. You should try your implementation with different types of triples and with const and non-const values, etc. Const correctness is assumed by all of the functions in this exercise.

**Note:**
Notice that template implementations such as this usually fail in the compile stage. Test your implementation carefully before submitting it, otherwise you might waste many solutions to code that simply doesn't compile.
Certain things can only be initialised in an initialiser list.
